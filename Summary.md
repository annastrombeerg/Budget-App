The Budget Calculator App is an Android application developed using Java and Android Studio, designed to help users manage and track their income and expenses. The app allows users to add and categorize their income, as well as create and categorize different types of expenses, such as fixed expenses, loans and credits, and variable expenses. The app provides an overview of the user's budget and displays a summary of their income and expenses visually in the form of a pie chart.
